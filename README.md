# ProjectCervical
Experimental project to use AI analyse cervical cancered cells

Using Vize I've trained my model to recognise normal cervical cells from cancered cells, and the level of cancer.
The project is still so much in it's infant stage, but the aim is to build it and change lives as well as time of doctors using
very first analyse and quick result generation.
